# JIRA given-when-then styling

This userscript provides auto-formatting for given-when-then (GWT) text in JIRA issue pages (description and comments).

- **stylised arrows**: the "->" arrows used in shorthand "given -> when -> then" sentences are stylised (replaced with "â†’" character, coloured and padded)

## Installing

This is a userscript that installs in any good browser. You'll get the best experience by:

1. Installing [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) to manage userscripts
2. Then just browse to a raw *.user.js file like [jira-gwt.user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-rk/jira-gwt/master/jira-gwt.user.js)
