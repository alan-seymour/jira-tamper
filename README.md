# JIRA given-when-then styling

This userscript provides auto-formatting for given-when-then (GWT) text in JIRA issue pages (description and comments).

- **stylised arrows**: the "->" arrows used in shorthand "given -> when -> then" sentences are stylised (replaced with "â†’" character, coloured and padded)

## Installing

This is a userscript that installs in any good browser. You'll get the best experience by installing [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) to manage userscripts, then just browse to a raw *.user.js file.
